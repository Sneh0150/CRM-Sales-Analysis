## üìä Data Preparation

### üîç Data Examination

In the initial phase of the project, I examined the original data files provided in CSV format. Below is a summary of the structure and content of each file:

---

---

Initially, the `sales_pipeline.csv` file contained full names for `sales_agent`, `product`, and `account` fields, referencing `sales_teams.csv`, `products.csv`, and `accounts.csv`. 

To optimize the data structure for performance and consistency, **ID columns** were added to these three reference files and used in the `sales_pipeline.csv` file instead.

## üîÑ Data Transformation

To prepare the data for efficient analysis, the following transformation steps were implemented:

1. **Add ID Columns**  
   Unique identifiers were added to `products.csv`, `accounts.csv`, and `sales_teams.csv`.

2. **Create Mapping Dictionaries**  
   Python dictionaries were created to map each ID to its original name for accurate replacement and traceability.

3. **Validate Data Consistency**  
   The mappings were cross-checked with `sales_pipeline.csv` to find and fix mismatches or missing references.

4. **Correct Misspelled Values**  
   Detected and corrected any inconsistencies or spelling errors across all related files.

5. **Replace Full Names with IDs**  
   The name-based fields in `sales_pipeline.csv` were replaced with the new numeric IDs for optimized performance.

6. **Save Updated Data**  
   All cleaned and transformed data was saved into new CSV files ready for import into the analysis environment.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Output

- **Language**: Python  
- **Script**: Included in a Jupyter Notebook  
- **Notebook**: `csv_files_preparation.ipynb`  
- **Transformed Files Directory**: `Modified_Files/`

This automated process ensured a clean, standardized, and analysis-ready dataset for the next phases of the CRM Sales Analysis project.
